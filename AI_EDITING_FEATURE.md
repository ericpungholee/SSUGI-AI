# AI Editing Feature Implementation

## Overview

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive AI editing feature for your document editor that works like Cursor's AI editing functionality. The feature includes preview diff, accept/reject functionality, and integrates seamlessly with your existing editor.

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Core Functionality
- **AI Edit API Endpoint** (`/api/ai/edit`) - Processes document editing requests
- **Diff Preview Component** - Shows inline changes with green insertions and red deletions
- **Floating Diff Toolbar** - Accept All, Reject All, and Expand Diff List controls
- **Per-block Accept/Reject** - Individual block controls with gutter badges
- **ProseMirror Integration** - Works with existing undo/redo system
- **Immutable Regions Protection** - Protects code blocks, inline code, and math expressions
- **Cursor Remapping** - Handles typing during preview mode gracefully

### ✅ User Interface
- **"Propose Edit" Button** - Added to editor toolbar with Sparkles icon
- **Keyboard Shortcut** - Ctrl+Shift+E to trigger AI editing
- **Progress Tracking** - Shows completion status of review process
- **Block-by-block Review** - Expandable blocks showing specific changes
- **Inline Diff Display** - Visual representation of additions/deletions

### ✅ Smart Features
- **Selection-based Editing** - Works with selected text or whole document
- **Intent-based Editing** - Supports different editing intents (improve writing, fix grammar, etc.)
- **Large Document Handling** - Warns for documents > 5000 characters
- **Protected Content** - Automatically detects and protects code blocks, math, etc.
- **Undo Integration** - All changes are undoable through existing undo system

## How It Works

### 1. User Interaction
1. User selects text (optional) or clicks "Propose Edit" button
2. System prompts for editing intent (e.g., "improve writing", "fix grammar")
3. AI processes the content and returns structured edit patches

### 2. Preview & Review
1. Floating toolbar appears with diff preview
2. User can expand individual blocks to see specific changes
3. Each block shows original vs. edited content with inline diff
4. User can accept/reject individual blocks or all at once

### 3. Application
1. Only accepted changes are applied to the document
2. Changes are saved to undo stack for easy reversal
3. Document content is updated with the edited version

## Technical Implementation

### Files Created/Modified
- `src/app/api/ai/edit/route.ts` - AI editing API endpoint
- `src/lib/ai/ai-edit.ts` - AI editing processing logic
- `src/components/editor/DiffPreview.tsx` - Diff preview component
- `src/components/editor/Editor.tsx` - Main editor integration

### Key Components

#### AI Edit API
- Takes document content and editing intent
- Returns structured patches with diff information
- Handles immutable region detection
- Supports cancellation and error handling

#### Diff Preview Component
- Shows floating toolbar with progress tracking
- Displays expandable block-by-block changes
- Provides accept/reject controls
- Handles visibility toggling

#### Editor Integration
- Added "Propose Edit" button to toolbar
- Keyboard shortcut support (Ctrl+Shift+E)
- Cursor remapping during preview
- Undo/redo integration

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
1. Click the Sparkles (✨) button in the toolbar
2. Enter editing intent when prompted
3. Review changes in the floating toolbar
4. Accept/reject individual blocks or all at once
5. Click "Apply Changes" to finalize

### Keyboard Shortcut
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+E` to quickly trigger AI editing with default intent

### Selection-based Editing
1. Select specific text to edit
2. Click "Propose Edit" or use keyboard shortcut
3. Only the selected text will be processed

## Edge Cases Handled

- **No-op patches**: Shows "No changes suggested" message
- **Large documents**: Warns and focuses on impactful improvements
- **Immutable regions**: Protects code blocks, inline code, and math
- **Typing during preview**: Warns user and handles gracefully
- **Cursor movement**: Maintains cursor position during preview
- **Nested nodes**: Preserves document structure and formatting

## Future Enhancements

The implementation is designed to be extensible. Potential future improvements could include:

- More sophisticated diff algorithms
- Real-time collaborative editing support
- Custom editing templates
- Integration with version control
- Advanced cursor remapping
- Batch editing operations

## Testing

To test the feature:

1. Open a document in the editor
2. Add some content (try including code blocks to test protection)
3. Click the Sparkles button or use Ctrl+Shift+E
4. Review the proposed changes
5. Accept/reject as desired
6. Apply changes and verify they work correctly

The feature is fully integrated with your existing editor and maintains all current functionality while adding powerful AI editing capabilities.
